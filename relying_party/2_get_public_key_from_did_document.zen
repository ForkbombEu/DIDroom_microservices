Scenario 'w3c': get public key from did document

Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'credential_issuer_did'
When I pickup from path 'credential_issuer_did.didDocument'

When I create 'es256' public key from did document 'didDocument'

When I create the 'string dictionary' named 'credential_issuer'
When I move the 'es256 public key' in 'credential_issuer'

Then print the 'credential_issuer' as 'base64'
