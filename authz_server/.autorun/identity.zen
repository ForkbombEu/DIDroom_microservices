## see if keyring exists and fails in case it is found
Given I send command 'command_search_keyring' and execute in shell and output into 'result'
Given I send path 'secrets_path' and verify file does not exist

## create and store keyring
Given I send path 'key_zen_path' and read verbatim file content and output into 'key_zen'
Given I send keys 'empty_keys' and send data 'key_data' and send script 'key_zen' and execute zencode and output secret into 'secrets'

## extract data for later
Given I send object 'secrets' and send path 'controller_path' and manipulate and get and output into 'controller'
Given I send object 'secrets' and send path 'controller' and manipulate and get and output secret into 'personal_keyring'

## read well-known
Given I send path 'well-known_path' and read file content and output into 'well-known'

Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'secrets'

Given I my name is in a 'string' named 'controller'
and I have a 'string' named 'controller'
and I have a 'keyring' in 'personal_keyring'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'well-known'

If I verify 'display' is found in 'well-known'
When I pickup from path 'well-known.display.1.name'
and I rename 'name' to 'description'
EndIf
If I verify 'display' is not found in 'well-known'
When I copy 'controller' to 'description'
EndIf
