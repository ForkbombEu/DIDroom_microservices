DIDroom microservices is a comprehensive open-source implementation of the OpenID4VC
"OpenID for Verifiable Credential" protocols, designed to easily deploy
the entire credential issuance process.This project is built using the
Zenroom ecosystem, incorporating Zencode natural language smart contracts
for secure, flexible, and human-readable protocol implementation.

## 🧱 Building blocks

### 🎫 Verifiable Credential issuer <!-- omit in toc -->

[OIDC4VCI REFERENCE](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html)

The credential issuer is the component that implements the endpoint to `issue` 
verifiable credentials in different formats (eg. w3c-vc, iso.18013-5 aka mDL)
actually it's agnostic to the format.

API for credential issuance is comprised of the following endpoints

**Mandatory**

```http
POST /credential
GET /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration
```

**Optionals**

```http
GET /credential_offer
GET /authorize
POST /batch_credential
POST /token
POST /op/par
POST /as/par
```

Core concepts of the issuer:
 * Wallets can request one OR batch requests for one OR multiple credentials
   with the same access token
 * Credentials can be issued syncronously or deferred
 * Multiple key proof types are supported
 * The same OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server can protect one or more Credential
   Issuers. Wallets determine the Credential Issuer's Authorization Server
   using the Credential Issuer's metadata


### 🚦 Authorization Server OAuth 2.0 <!-- omit in toc -->

[REFERENCE RFC6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.txt)

Credential Issuers use OAuth 2.0 RFC6749 Authorization Server for access.
A single server can protect multiple Issuers, identified via metadata (/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer).
All OAuth 2.0 Grant Types and extensions work with the credential issuance API. Unspecified aspects follow [@!RFC6749].
Some tweaks and enhancements are needed although, this extensions include:

- **New Authorization Details Type - `openid_credential`:**
  - Conveys Credential details Wallet aims to obtain (see [#authorization-details](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html#authorization-details)).

- **New Token Response Error Codes:**
  - `authorization_pending` and `slow_down` support deferred authorization for Pre-Authorized Code grant type.

- **Client Metadata:**
  - Uses client metadata, introducing `credential_offer_endpoint` for Wallet to publish its Credential Offer Endpoint (see [#client-metadata](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html#client-metadata)).

- **Authorization Endpoint Enhancements:**
  - Adds `issuer_state` for issuer-initiated Credential Offer processing (see [#credential-authz-request](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html#credential-authz-request)).
  - Introduces `wallet_issuer` and `user_hint` for Credential Issuers to request Verifiable Presentations during Authorization Request.

- **Token Endpoint Enhancements:**
  - Adds optional response parameters - `c_nonce` and `c_nonce_expires_in` - for nonce-based proof of possession of key material (see [#token-response](https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html#token-response)).
